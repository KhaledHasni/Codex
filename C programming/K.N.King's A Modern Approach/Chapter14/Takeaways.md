## :wrench: How The Preprocessor Works

* The preprocessor is controlled by a special type of commands called "preprocessing directives".
   * These are commands in a C program that begin with the ```#``` character.
* Two of the most common preprocessing directives are ```#define``` and ```#include```.
   * The ```#define``` directive defines what is called a "macro".
      * A macro is a name that represents something else, usually a frequently used constant or expression.
      * When the preprocessor executes a ```#define``` directive, it stores the macro along with the value it represents called its "definition".
      * When that macro is later encountered in the program text, the preprocessor "expands" it. This means it replaces it with the value it represents.
   * The ```#include``` directive opens a designated file and copies its content into the file being compiled.
* The preprocessor comes before the compiler in a C program's compilation chain.
   * Preprocessing is the first stage that a C program goes through when being compiled.
   * The preprocessor executes any directives contained in the original program.
   * An executed directive is then removed from the program text.
   * The preprocessor produces a modified version of the original program.
      * Lines containing preprocessing directives (except ```#include```) are replaced with empty lines.
      * The content of files included using the ```#include``` directive are pasted.
      * Macros are expanded.
      * Comments are replaced with a single space character.
      * Some preprocessors remove unnecessary whitespace characters.
* Modern C preprocessors and compilers are not necessarily distinct entities.
   * Older preprocessors used to come in the form of a program, distinct from the compiler.
   * Such preprocessors will modify the original program and feed their output into the compiler.
   * Modern preprocessors and compilers are usually bundled together.
   * Modern preprocessor output is not always pure C code.
      * A common example of this is the preprocessor's response to an ```#include``` directive, which doesn't always copy the content of files into the current translation unit. Some modern preprocessors merely make functions declared in the file, available to the current translation unit.
    * Most C compilers offer the ability to see the preprocessor's output.
       * GNU's GCC will do this when the ```-E``` option is used.
* It's important to bear in mind that the preprocessor only has a limited knowledge of the C programming language.
   * It's not uncommon for the preprocessor to create invalid statements or illegal expressions after processing a program.
