## :gear: Bitwise Operators

* C provides six bitwise operators that can be used to operate on integers at the bit level.
   * The bitwise left shift operator ```<<```.
   * The bitwise right shift operator ```>>```.
   * The bitwise complement operator ```~```.
   * The bitwise and operator ```&```.
   * The bitwise exclusive or operator ```^```.
   * The bitwise inclusive or operator ```|```.

### :small_blue_diamond: Bitwise Shift Operators

* C provides two bitwise shift operators.
   * The bitwise left shift operator ```<<```.
   * The bitwise right shift operator ```>>```.
* C's bitwise shift operators are used to transform the binary representation of an integer operand by shifting its bits left or right.
* C's bitwise shift operators support operands of any integer type including ```char```.
   * Integer promotions are performed on both operands.
   * The result has the type of the left operand after promotion.
* Both of C's bitwise shift operators are binary.
   * These operators expect two integer operands.
   * Assuming ```i``` and ```j``` are two integers:
      * ```i << j``` causes all bits in ```i```'s binary representation to be shifted ```j``` places to the left.
         * For every bit (no matter the value) shifted off the left end of ```i```, a ```0``` is added to the right end.
      * ```i >> j``` causes all bits in ```i```'s binary representation to be shifted ```j``` places to the right.
         * If ```i``` has an unsigned type or a nonnegative value, for each bit shifted off the right end of ```i```, a ```0``` is introduced at the left end.
         * If ```i``` has a negative value, the result is implementation-defined.
            * Some implementations add a ```0``` for every bit shifted off the right end of ```i```.
            * Some implementations add a ```1``` for every bit shifted off the right end of ```i``` to preserve the sign.
* It's usually best to avoid performing bit shifting on signed numbers to ensure we always write portable programs.
* Since neither bitwise shift operator has side effects, C provides bitwise shift compound assignment operators ```<<=``` and ```>>=```.
* C's bitwise right and left shift operators have the same level of precedence.
* C's bitwise shift operators are left-associative.
* C's bitwise shift operators have lower precedence compared to C's arithmetic operators.

### :small_blue_diamond: Bitwise Complement, And, Exclusive Or and Inclusive Or Operators

* C's bitwise complement operator ```~``` is unary.
   * It requires a single integer operand.
   * Integer promotions are performed on its operand.
* C's bitwise and ```&```, bitwise exclusive ```^``` and inclusive or ```|``` operators are binary.
   * They require two integer operands.
   * The usual arithmetic conversions are performed on their operands.
* All four operators perform boolean operations on their operands at the bit level.
   * ```~``` produces the complement of its operand.
      * ```0```s are replaced by ```1```s and vice versa.
   * ```&``` performs a boolean and operation on every pair of corresponding bits in its operands.
      * ```0 & 0 = 0```.
      * ```0 & 1 = 0```.
      * ```1 & 1 = 1```.
      * ```&``` is commutative.
   * ```^``` performs a boolean exclusive or operation on every pair of corresponding bits in its operands. Two ```1```s produce a ```0```.
      * ```0 ^ 0 = 0```.
      * ```0 ^ 1 = 1```.
      * ```1 ^ 1 = 0```.
      * ```^``` is commutative.
   * ```|``` performs a boolean inclusive or operation on every pair of corresponding bits in its operands. Two ```1```s produce a ```1```.
      * ```0 | 0 = 0```.
      * ```0 | 1 = 1```.
      * ```1 | 1 = 1```.
      * ```|``` is commutative.
* It's important not to confuse the bitwise ```&``` and ```|``` operators with the logical ```&&``` and ```||``` operators respectively.
* To ensure program portability, C programmers usually use the bitwise complement operator ```~``` for several purposes.
   * ```~0``` produces an integer with all ```1```s irrespective of its size.
   * ```~0x7``` produces an integer with all ```1```s except for the three least significant bits, irrespective of its size.
* All four operators have the following relative level of precedence from highest to lowest:
   * The bitwise complement operator ```~```.
   * The bitwise and operator ```&```.
   * The bitwise exclusive or operator ```^```.
   * The bitwise inclusive or operator ```|```.
* C's bitwise shift operators have lower precedence compared to the bitwise complement operator ```~``` and higher precedence compared to the remaining three bitwise operators.
* All four operators have lower precedence compared to C's relational and equality operators.
   * This leads to common traps. Assuming ```a``` is an integer variable:
      * ```a & 5 == b``` is equivalent to ```a & (5 == b)``` which is perhaps not what first comes to mind when writing such an expression.
* All four operators do not have side effects. For this reason, C provides corresponding compound assignment operators:
   * ```~=```.
   * ```&=```.
   * ```^=```.
   * ```|=```.
* C's bitwise operators can be used to achieve some of the most common low-level operations. Assuming ```i``` is an integer variable and ```j``` is an integer:
   * Setting a bit: ```i |= 1 << j``` sets the ```j```th bit in ```i``` (assuming the least significant bit is bit ```0```).
   * Clearing a bit: ```i &= ~(1 << j)``` clears the ```j```th bit in ```i``` (assuming the least significant bit it bit ```0```).
   * Testing a bit: ```i & 1 << j``` produces a nonzero value if the ```j```th bit in ```i``` is set, and produces ```0``` otherwise.
* When working with bit fields instead of individual bits, single bitwise operations are usually not enough to achieve what we want. Assuming ```i``` is an integer variable and ```j``` is an integer:
   * Suppose we want to set the bits that make up ```j``` in a certain position in ```i```.
      * First thing to do is to determine the width of the bit field to be set. We'll call this width ```w```.
      * Next, we need to determine the position at which we want to insert ```j```'s bits. We'll call this position ```p```.
      * Let ```a``` be the integer formed by the bit field with width ```w``` shifted to position ```p``` containing all ```1```s with everything else being ```0```.
      * ```i & a | j << p``` inserts ```j``` into ```i``` at position ```p```.
         * Example: If we want to insert ```101``` in ```i``` at position 4-6:
            * ```j``` is ```101``` in this case.
            * ```j```'s width is ```3```.
            * The insert position into ```i``` is ```4```.
            * ```a``` is ```0x0070```.
            * ```i & 0x0070 | 0x0050``` inserts ```j``` into ```i``` at position ```4```.
            * A more general form would be ```i & 0x0070 | j << 4```.
   * Suppose we want to retrieve a bit field with a particular width at a particular position from an integer variable ```i```.
      * First thing to do is to determine the width of the bit field to be set. We'll call this width ```w```.
      * Let ```a``` be the integer formed by the bit field with width ```w``` containing all ```1```s at the right end.
      * If the bit field is at the right end of ```i```:
         * ```i & a``` retrieves the bit field of width ```w``` from ```i```.
      * If the bit field is not at the right end of ```i```:
         * Let ```p``` be the position at which the bit field in ```i``` starts.
         * ```(i >> p) & a``` retrieves the bit field of width ```w```, at position ```p``` from ```i```.

## :clamp: Bit-Fields In Structures

* C allows using bit fields in structure members of type ```int```, ```unsigned int``` and ```signed int```.
   * Assuming ```date_t``` is a structure type used to represent a date:
   ```c
   struct date_t {
      unsigned int day: 5;
      unsigned int month: 4;
      unsigned int year: 7;
   };
   ```
   * The number after each colon ```:``` represents the structure member's length in bits.
   * The declaration can be made shorter since all three bit fields have the same type:
   ```c
   struct date_t {
      unsigned int day: 5, month: 4, year: 7;
   };
   ```
* A bit field's type must be either ```int```, ```unsigned int``` or ```signed int```.
   * Using ```int``` may hurt program portability because some compilers will treat the most significant bit in the bit field as a sign bit, while others won't.
   * To ensure we write portable low-level programs, it's best to use ```unsigned int``` or ```signed int``` for bit fields.
* C99 allows bit fields to be of type ```_Bool```.
* Bit fields can be accessed and used just like any other structure member.
* Since bit fields in structures don't have ordinary addresses in memory, C prohibits applying the address operator ```&``` to a bit field.
   * For this reason, functions like ```scanf``` can't read data directly into a bit field.
   * C still allows assignment to a bit field.
* How a compiler processes the declaration of a structure that has bit field members depends on the concept of "storage unit".
   * A storage unit is the smallest unit of data storage in main memory.
   * The size of a storage unit is implementation-defined. Typical values are ```8```, ```16``` and ```32``` bits.
   * The compiler processes bit field structure members one by one, storing them contiguously in a storage unit with no holes in between.
   * When the remaining space in a storage unit is not enough to store the next bit field, the compiler's behavior is implementation-defined.
      * Some compilers skip to the start of the next storage unit.
      * Other compilers split the bit field between both storage units.
   * Whether bit fields are stored from right to left or left to right inside a storage unit is implementation-defined.
* C allows adding nameless bit fields as structure members.
   * These bit fields serve as paddings to ensure other bit fields are positioned correctly inside a storage unit.
   ```c
   struct date_t {
      unsigned int day: 5;
      unsigned int : 4;
      unsigned int year: 7;
   };
   ```
   * The second bit field member in the previous example is not named. The compiler will therefore leave it out.
   * The ```year``` bit field will still be positioned as if the second member existed.
   * Some C programmers set an unnamed bit field's length to ```0```. This effectively tells the compiler to skip to the start of the next storage unit before storing the next bit field.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Other Low-Level Techniques

* Depending on the platform they're working on, some C programmers define machine-dependent types.
   * The ```char``` type, by definition, stores a single byte of data.
      * For this reason, characters are sometimes treated as byte storage units for data that's not necessarily in character form.
      * When this is done extensively throughout a program, C programmers will often define a dedicated type ```typedef unsigned char BYTE;```.
   * Some platforms rely heavily on 16-bit words for data storage.
      * For such platforms, it's a good idea to define a dedicated type ```typedef unsigned short WORD;```
* Unions in C can be used to view a block of memory in more than one way.
   * Assuming we have a structure containing bit field members that fit into two adjacent bytes of memory.
   * Any two bytes, including any ```unsigned short``` value, can be viewed as an instance of this structure.
   ```c
   union is_this_a_date {
      struct date_t date;
      unsigned short a;
   };
   ```
   * Assuming the following union declaration is in effect: ```union is_this_a_date u```:
      * Assigning a ```unsigned short``` value to ```u.a``` will automatically populate all its fields in the ```date``` structure.
* When a data item is stored over one or more bytes, there are two ways this storage can take place in memory:
   * In the natural order: The most significant byte stored first. This type of storage is called "Big-Endian".
   * In the reverse order: The most significant byte stored last. This type of storage is called "Little-Endian".
   * C has no preference over which type of storage is used. This depends entirely on the CPU running the program.
* Most C programs don't need to worry about byte ordering when storing data unless it's dealing with memory at a low level or reading files that contain data in non-character form.
* When using unions to view data in more than one way, it's common for an item that's valid in its original form to become invalid when viewed as a different type.
* It's sometimes useful to create a pointer variable that holds a specific address.
* An address usually has the same number of bits as an integer (or a long integer).
   * Assuming we want to create a pointer to an integer stored at the address ```0x1234```.
   ```c
   int *p;

   p = (int *) 0x1234;
   ```
   * We can declare a pointer variable capable of pointing to data of type ```int```.
   * Cast the address value ```0x1234``` to an integer pointer.
* Data stored in some memory locations can change while a program is being executed, even though the program itself is not actively changing it. Such memory locations are called "volatile".
   * A storage unit that stores data read directly from a user keyboard is an example of a volatile memory location.
* C provides the ```volatile``` keyword that allows us to inform the compiler of the volatile nature of a data item.
* Declaring a pointer variable ```p``` as volatile tells the compiler that ```*p``` should be fetched from memory every time it's needed.
* When a CPU executes a program in "protected mode," the program can only access memory portions that belong to it. This prevents it from changing data that belongs to other applications or to the operating system.
