## :house: Local Variables

* A variable declared inside the body of a function is said to be ```local``` to that function.
* Local variables in C have several default properties:
   * They have ```automatic storage duration```.
      * The storage duration (also called extent) of a variable is the portion of program execution during which storage for the variable exists.
      * A local variable's storage is automatically allocated when the enclosing function is called and deallocated once it returns.
      * Since its storage is deallocated when its enclosing function returns, a local variable does not retain its value once control is transferred outside the function.
      * If the function is called again, C does not guarantee that the local variable will have the same value.
      * A local variable's storage exists from the moment the enclosing function is called, just long enough for it to return.
   * They have ```block scope```.
      * The scope of a variable is the portion of the program's text in which the variable can be referenced.
      * A local variable can be referenced from its point of declaration to the end of the enclosing function's body. In C terminology, we say it has "block scope".
      * Once control is transferred outside the enclosing function, a local variable can no longer be referenced. Consequently, its name can be used for other purposes.
* Storage for an automatic local variable exists from the moment the enclosing function is called, even if the variable hasn't yet been declared in the function's body.
   * The compiler knows all the local variables at compile time and reserves one contiguous block of stack space for them as part of the functionâ€™s activation record also known as its ```stack frame```.
* C99 doesn't require local variable declarations to be at the beginning of the function.
   * As a result, a local variable can have very limited scope if its declaration happens near the end of the function's body.
* Adding the word ```static``` in front of a local variable's declaration gives it ```static storage duration``` instead of automatic storage duration.
   * Variables with static storage have a permanent storage location in memory.
   * They retain their value when the enclosing function returns.
   * They still have block scope and therefore can't be referenced once control is transferred outside of the enclosing function.
* It might be tempting to ask: If a static local variable can't be referenced outside of the enclosing function, what's the purpose of it retaining its value once the function returns?
   * Static local variables are used to preserve data across calls to the same function while keeping it hidden from the rest of the program.
* Function parameters have the same properties as automatic local variables:
   * Automatic storage duration.
   * Block scope.
   * The only difference between the two is that parameters are automatically initialized with the value of the corresponding argument when the function is called.

## :earth_africa: External Variables

* C offers multiple ways to transfer information between different functions. Two of the most frequently used are:
   * Passing arguments.
   * ```External variables```, also known as global variables.
* An external variable is a variable declared outside of all functions.
* External variables in C have the following default properties:
   * They have static storage duration.
      * A value stored in a global variable will remain there for the lifetime of the program unless intentionally changed.
   * They have ```file scope```.
      * An external variable can be referenced anywhere from its point of declaration until the end of the enclosing file.
      * An external variable is visible inside all functions defined in the same file, provided those functions appear after its declaration.
* It's important not to abuse external variables since their excessive use can quickly degrade the quality of a program in multiple ways:
   * It hurts program maintainability: Changing an external variable must be done carefully since it impacts multiple functions.
   * It makes programs harder to debug: If an external variable contains an unexpected value during program execution, it becomes difficult to trace its root cause because multiple functions may access and modify it.
   * It hurts program portability: A function that uses an external variable is not self-contained and cannot be reused for other purposes.

## :package: Blocks

* A compound statement is any group of statements enclosed in a pair of braces: ```{statements}```.
* A compound statement can be used anywhere a statement is allowed.
* C allows a compound statement to contain declarations: ```{declarations statements}```. Such a statement is called a ```block```.
* Variables declared inside blocks have several default properties:
   * They have automatic storage duration.
      * Storage for a variable declared in a block is allocated when the block is entered and deallocated when the block is exited.
   * They have block scope.
      * A variable declared inside a block is visible from the point of its declaration until the end of the enclosing block.
   * Adding the keyword ```static``` in front of its declaration will give such a variable static storage duration.
* A function's body is a block.
* Some C programmers use blocks inside functions for different reasons:
   * To avoid dumping a load of variables at the beginning of the function, especially if some of them won't be needed until further down in the function body.
   * To reduce name conflict especially for variables with generic names like ```i``` and ```temp```.
* C99 does not require variables to be declared at the beginning of a block.
   * As a result, a variable declared inside a block may have very limited scope if its declaration happens near the end of the block.

## :telescope: Scope

* An identifier in a C program may have several different meanings. The compiler relies on C's ```scope rules``` to determine the relevant meaning at different stages in the program.
* C's most important scope rule is the following:
   * If an identifier is declared inside a block where it's already visible, the new declaration overrides the old one and the identifier takes on a new role until the enclosing block is exited, at which point, it regains its old meaning.
   * Two common scenarios may lead to this situation:
      * The original identifier has file scope.
      * The current block is nested inside another one, and the original identifier was already declared inside the outer block.
